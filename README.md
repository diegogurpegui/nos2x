# nos2x-fox (nos2x for Firefox)

notes and other stuff signed by an extension

This is a fork from https://github.com/fiatjaf/nos2x focused on Firefox and related browsers.

## Nostr Signer Extension

This allows you to sign [Nostr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr) events on web-apps without having to give them your keys.

It provides a `window.nostr` object which has the following methods:

```
async window.nostr.getPublicKey(): string // returns your public key as hex
async window.nostr.signEvent(event): Event // returns the full event object signed
async window.nostr.getRelays(): { [url: string]: RelayPolicy } // returns a map of relays
async window.nostr.nip04.encrypt(pubkey, plaintext): string // returns ciphertext+iv as specified in nip04
async window.nostr.nip04.decrypt(pubkey, ciphertext): string // takes ciphertext+iv as specified in nip04
```

## Install

- By yourself from file: look into [Releases](https://github.com/diegogurpegui/nos2x-fox/releases)
- From the site [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nos2x-fox/)

## Develop

To run the plugin from this code:
